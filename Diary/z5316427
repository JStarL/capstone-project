Week 1
Narrow down three project proposals and selected a scrum master. 
Also made a meeting date on monday to decide on further stuff.



Week 2

We assigned tasks to to the proposal. Made a google doc to collect all our ideas. Decided to meet
every monday to check in and decide on tasks. I was assigned to do the system architecture. We also finalised
the novel function we will be doing. We also made user stories to match the specs.


Week 3
We spent time finalising the proposal by looking at the report and making sure everything was correct.
We also double checked the storyboards and the diagram for the system architecture.
