Week 1

We formed our group before our Friday lab class and had set up our team on Moodle.
We spent time during lab deciding which project to choose.
I volunteered to be scrum master.
We were talking about various things like:
    potential novel ideas
    software and libraries to use

Week 2

We chose Project 1 - Wait Management System, and spent most of the week through
lengthy brainstorming sessions of figuring out what could be our novel functionalities.
We came up with several ideas and discussed them with our tutor and lecturer.
We finished the basic user stories on Jira, decided on our sprint structure and
finished the background of the proposal.
We plan to select our novel ideas towards the beginning of Week 3, and add user stories for these
Patrick and I will also complete the storyboards, software architecture diagram and
technical specifications of the project for the proposal by Thursday, Week 3.

Week 3

Early in week 3, we finally decided our novel functionalities.
Throughout Week 3, all of us were busy working on the proposal,
which was successfully submitted by the deadline. My main parts
were to work on some of the customer storyboards like the persona related
screens and the basic screens like looking at menu item descriptions.
I also did a lot of reviewing of the storyboards as a whole, and sat with Rohan
to review and finalise the sprint screenshots.
Next week we plan to work on deciding what work there is to build the system,
and who will be doing what, as well as  potentially create an interface
between the backend and frontend so that we can all start working together.

Week 4
On Monday we had a meeting where we discussed and elaborated on the
interface between the frontend and backend (think SwaggerDocs), and
all routes and associated information that would be sent to either the frontend or backend.
