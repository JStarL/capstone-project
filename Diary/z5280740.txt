Week 1

We formed our group before our Friday lab class and had set up our team on Moodle.
We spent time during lab deciding which project to choose.
I volunteered to be scrum master.
We were talking about various things like:
    potential novel ideas
    software and libraries to use

Week 2

We chose Project 1 - Wait Management System, and spent most of the week through
lengthy brainstorming sessions of figuring out what could be our novel functionalities.
We came up with several ideas and discussed them with our tutor and lecturer.
We finished the basic user stories on Jira, decided on our sprint structure and
finished the background of the proposal.
We plan to select our novel ideas towards the beginning of Week 3, and add user stories for these
We will also complete the storyboards, software architecture diagram and
technical specifications of the project for the proposal by Thursday, Week 3.
