Week 1
- Met our group for the first time.
- Decided meeting time to be on Monday 2pm.
- Jibitesh put his hand up to be Scrum master
- Read through the project specs together
- Read through all the project topics together
- Allocated tasks for each person to do in the business proposal


Week 2
- I got done most of my allocated parts of the proposal (user stories, as well as consolidating all project requirements down to 6 functionalities)
- We seem to be struggling with choosing our novel functionalities as for everything we've come up with, there seems to be a problem. This 
has been quite frustrating but I think in the end, we will choose the onese we believe to be novel, and justify that claim to the best of our ability.
- I am yet to do the user stories for our novel functionalities as we are still deciding on them.
- I also am about to start drafting the report.
- But overall, We all seem on track with our progress for the proposal.

Week 3
- We finished our proposal!
- I had drafted the report and completed listing out all the functionalities
- The main issue is that we didn't have enough user stories. So I had to add 10 more user stories to ensure that we covered every aspect of the system
- Under some of these new 10 user stories, we had to create a new functionality (authentification) and correspondingly a new epic
- Added child issues in the user stories for frontend developers and backend developers to know what to do.
- Ready to start implementation of tasks in Sprint 2! Specifically, I want to start the backend of the manager user stories relating to categories.

Week 4
- This week was quite stressful as we ran into a lot of setup issues, so we actually didn't get to spend any time coding yet.
- Although we planned on starting to implement the code, I could't yet.
- We ran into issues because vlab didn't offer compatibility with psycopg2 and so we had to make the switch to using a vm. This process took quite long
as we ran into errors. These errors took a while trying to fix. Then we had install all the backend, frontend and database software on the vm which was
quite tricky as the instructions weren't super clear on how to do this. Once we installed it all, I realised I couldn't use git on my local vscode,
so I had to install another bash terminal just to be able to use git. 
- These obstacles were overcome by having meetings with Jibi who was able to help me.
- It did set us back more than we liked, which slowed down the project progress.
- In our meetings, we created an interface table and highlighted which routes corresponded to sprint 2 for us to start coding.
- What is planned for next week is to complete the sql code for the backend user stories, and flask code for the function wrappers in server.py.
