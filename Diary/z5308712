Week 1
- Met our group for the first time.
- Decided meeting time to be on Monday 2pm.
- Read through the project specs together
- Read through all the project topics together
- Allocated tasks for each person to do in the business proposal


Week 2
- I got done most of my allocated parts of the proposal (user stories, as well as consolidating all project requirements down to 6 functionalities)
- We seem to be struggling with choosing our novel functionalities as for everything we've come up with, there seems to be a problem. This 
has been quite frustrating but I think in the end, we will choose the onese we believe to be novel, and justify that claim to the best of our ability.
- I am yet to do the user stories for our novel functionalities as we are still deciding on them.
- I also am about to start drafting the report.
- But overall, We all seem on track with our progress for the proposal.
