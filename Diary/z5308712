Week 1
- Met our group for the first time.
- Decided meeting time to be on Monday 2pm.
- Jibitesh put his hand up to be Scrum master
- Read through the project specs together
- Read through all the project topics together
- Allocated tasks for each person to do in the business proposal


Week 2
- I got done most of my allocated parts of the proposal (user stories, as well as consolidating all project requirements down to 6 functionalities)
- We seem to be struggling with choosing our novel functionalities as for everything we've come up with, there seems to be a problem. This 
has been quite frustrating but I think in the end, we will choose the onese we believe to be novel, and justify that claim to the best of our ability.
- I am yet to do the user stories for our novel functionalities as we are still deciding on them.
- I also am about to start drafting the report.
- But overall, We all seem on track with our progress for the proposal.

Week 3
- We finished our proposal!
- I had drafted the report and completed listing out all the functionalities
- The main issue is that we didn't have enough user stories. So I had to add 10 more user stories to ensure that we covered every aspect of the system
- Under some of these new 10 user stories, we had to create a new functionality (authentification) and correspondingly a new epic
- Added child issues in the user stories for frontend developers and backend developers to know what to do.
- Ready to start implementation of tasks in Sprint 2! Specifically, I want to start the backend of the manager user stories relating to categories.

Week 4
- This week was quite stressful as we ran into a lot of setup issues, so we actually didn't get to spend any time coding yet.
- Although we planned on starting to implement the code, I could't yet.
- We ran into issues because vlab didn't offer compatibility with psycopg2 and so we had to make the switch to using a vm. This process took quite long
as we ran into errors. These errors took a while trying to fix. Then we had install all the backend, frontend and database software on the vm which was
quite tricky as the instructions weren't super clear on how to do this. Once we installed it all, I realised I couldn't use git on my local vscode,
so I had to install another bash terminal just to be able to use git. 
- These obstacles were overcome by having meetings with Jibi who was able to help me.
- It did set us back more than we liked, which slowed down the project progress.
- In our meetings, we created an interface table and highlighted which routes corresponded to sprint 2 for us to start coding.
- What is planned for next week is to complete the sql code for the backend user stories, and flask code for the function wrappers in server.py.

Week 5
- We completed our demo succesfully within 10-12 mins!
- We completed all of our user stories for the first sprint, and did testing to ensure that the backend and frontend worked well together.
- Personally, I didn't run into too many issues in the functions delegated to me in the backend. However, the frontend had some issues.
- For the best selling category, we based it off popularity however for it to be novel, it needs to also be based on another criteria which we will discuss at a later sprint.
- We completed our retrospective meeting soon after the demo and identified areas for improvement.
- Next week is flexi week so it will be more relaxed but we will decide what user stories we want to do in the next sprint, as well as delegating tasks

Week 6
- This week was more relaxed week for me as it was flexibility week.
- We did have a meeting to decide all the user stories we want to do for this upcoming sprint and we also delegated user stories for each person to do.
- We all took part in creating the interface table in google docs so we know how to structure our functions (params, and returns).
- I also started coding on the functions that was assigned to me.
- Next week, I want all of my code to be completed and to do more API Client Testing.

Week 7
- I completed all my functions that I had to do but had to make some slight changes
- We have to prepare for our demo and ensure we spend enough time on the user stories of this sprint.
- Didn't really run into any challenges on the backend!
- Plan for next week is to practice our demo a few times and ensure that all user stories are covered within 12 mins.

Week 8
- We completed our demo B succesfully within 12 mins!
- We completed all the relevant user stories for this sprint and ensure that the backend and frontend worked well together.
- We also ran into a few issues of where some of the user stories in the first sprint stopped working, but we debugged that.
- We completed our retrospective soon after, and we found that we had tried out most of the things we set out to do and it had helped us achieve a more organized timeline of our sprint.
- Next week, we plan on allocating user stories for us to do in the last sprint.

Week 9
- I had completed my 4 routes already! (wait_staff/get_ordered_list, wait_staff/mark_order_complete, wait_staff/get_assistance_notifications, wait_staff/mark_notification_complete)
- These were fairly easy for me to code up as it was just dictionary manipulation
- Next week the plan is to refactor all our code and eliminate all code smells
- We also plan on preparing our report, and preparing our final demo.

Week 10
- We had a lot of demo practice, as we met 3 times during the week.
- I completed refactoring code on the backend. I refactored both auth.py and customer.py
- I also worked on the project report. I had completed the overview section, the functionalities section, and had written some stuff on the user manual and installation section.
- The plan for after the demo is to do the peer evaluation and proof read the entire report.
