# The following assumptions are made throughout the project

- All menu items of a given customer are served by the waiter when *all* menu items are prepared by the kitchen staff, so the entire order is served as a whole, at once

- The 'Best Selling' category is completely automated and not editable by the manager. This means that:
    - Items cannot be added or removed manually by the manager from this category
    - The ordering of menu items within this category cannot be manually changed
    - The 'Best Selling' category is always the first category in the categories panel, its order cannot be changed
    - The 'Best Selling' category dynamically updates based on internally maintained statistics
